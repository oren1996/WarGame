# WarGame
This is my first project in Java.
This code implements a card game called "War." The game is played between two players, each of whom is dealt half of a shuffled deck of 52 cards. The players then take turns drawing the top card from their respective decks and comparing the cards' numbers. The player with the higher card takes both cards and adds them to the bottom of their deck. If the cards are of the same value, then a "war" is declared, and each player draws three cards from their deck and plays another round. The game continues until one player has all of the cards.
